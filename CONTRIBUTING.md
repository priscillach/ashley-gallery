```

``` 
# Output to /images/ directory
road-fog-large.jpg
road-fog-med.jpg
road-fog-small.jpg
```

## Notes
The eleventy configuration file, `.eleventy.js` is currently configured to use manual passthrough file copy to include the following directories in the `_site` output. 

- `/images/`
- `/css/`
- `/favicon_data/`
- `/js/` 

The `/_includes/` directory houses the two layouts for this project.

- `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: home page template
- `_includes/layouts/feature.njk`: featured image page template
