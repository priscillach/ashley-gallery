                "jpg": "/images/shop-plants-large.jpg",
                "width": "1024w"
            },
            "medium": {
                "webp": "/images/shop-plants-med.webp",
                "jpg": "/images/shop-plants-med.jpg",
                "width": "640w"
            },
            "small": {
                "webp": "/images/shop-plants-small.webp",
                "jpg": "/images/shop-plants-small.jpg",
                "width": "320w"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Add new photos to the gallery
1. Get an image from somewhere (your file system, a stock photo website, etc)
2. Add the original image to the `/images/` folder.
3. Go into `.eleventy.js` and utilize `sharpImages`
4. This creates three resized images from the original, which outputs to the `/images/` folder:

```
sharpImages("./images/road-fog.jpg");
```

``` 
road-fog-large.webp
road-fog-med.webp
road-fog-small.webp
```

5. Include the images in `/images/` if you create the resized images externally.
6. Go into `_data/gallery.json` and create a new object with the image metadata

> Note: `.webp` and `.jpg` formats are required to utilize `srcSet` for both the WebP images in `<picture>` as well as the fallback `<img>` to account for the 15% of Web users that still don't have WebP support.

If you don't use `sharpImages`, head over to [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app) and create the three resized (1024px, 640px, 320px) `.webp` and `.jpg` formats from your original image.
