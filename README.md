## Getting Started
You can quickly generate a new repository from this template by clicking the green [Use Template](https://github.com/tannerdolby/eleventy-photo-gallery/generate) button. Creating a template repository provides the same directory structure and files as the original project.

## Features
- Responsive and optimized images using `<picture>`
- Home page with CSS Grid representing gallery of images
- Featured image page
- About me page

## Local Setup
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/tannerdolby/eleventy-photo-gallery.git`
2. Navigate to your local copy of the project: `cd eleventy-photo-gallery`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Serve locally: `npm run serve`

## Usage

Edit `_data/gallery.json` to include the appropiate image metadata. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tannerdolby/eleventy-photo-gallery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more on customizing your own photo/art gallery.

Use the `sharpImages` function inside `.eleventy.js` to create three resized versions of the original image.

1. Get an image from somewhere (your file system, a stock photo website, etc)
2. Add the original image to the `/images/` folder.
3. Go into `.eleventy.js` and utilize `sharpImages`
4. This creates three resized images from the original, which outputs to the `/images/` folder:

```
sharpImages("./images/road-fog.jpg");
```

``` 
road-fog-large.webp
road-fog-med.webp
road-fog-small.webp
```

5. Include the images in `/images/` if you create the resized images externally.
6. Go into `_data/gallery.json` and create a new object with the image metadata
